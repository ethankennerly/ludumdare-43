- [ ] You already have a note that scoring is TODO.
- [ ] I was challenged as I don't know the rules of Go. I believe the final time was the best play?
- [ ] Also noticed that in the final play, the move for the first player flashed at a few places on the board but clicking didn't play the move. Not knowing the rules of the game, I wasn't sure what to do next, so I quit. :)
- [x] I liked the graphics, sounds, icons, and animations.
- [ ] Perhaps a little cheatsheet of the Go shape currently in-the-making would be helpful for newbie players?
